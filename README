It describes how you can install all missing packages using the command-line version of nuget.exe with the following command: NuGet install MyProject\packages.config –OutputDirectory Packages

From the documentation:

usage: NuGet install packageId|pathToPackagesConfig [options]

Install a package from a given source. If no source is specified the default feed is used.

     Specify the id and optionally the version of the package to install. If a path to a  
     packages.config file is used instead of an id, all the packages it contains are installed.

options:

Source                     The location to look for packages. 
OutputDirectory            Specifies the directory in which packages will be installed 
Version                    The version of the package to install.
ExcludeVersion       (x)   If set, the destination folder will contain only the package name, not the version number
